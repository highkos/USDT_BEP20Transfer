## 🎮 Getting Started (It's Easy-Peasy!)

### 📋 Prerequisites (The Boring-But-Important Stuff)

- 📦 .NET 6.0 SDK (because we're fancy and modern)
- 💳 A BSC wallet with:
  - USDT tokens (BEP20 flavor - the yummy one)
  - Some BNB for gas (think of it as tip money for the blockchain)
- 📱 Binance TR account (your token's final destination)

2. Build it like Bob the Builder:
cd USDT_BEP20Transfer
dotnet build
3. Run it like Forrest Gump:
dotnet run
## ⚙️ Configuration (The Control Panel)

First launch will create your `appsettings.json` - your personal command center! Here's what you can tweak:

- 📤 **From Address**: Your BSC wallet (where your tokens are chillin')

- 🔐 **Private Key**: Your super-secret key (Shhhh! 🤫)

## 🎯 How to Use (For Humans)

1. 🚀 Launch the app (no rocket science degree required)

3. 🧪 Toggle test mode (because YOLO is not a good crypto strategy)
4. 💸 Make your transfer (and feel like a crypto pro!)
5. 🔍 Track your transaction (watch your tokens travel in style)

## 🛡️ Safety First! (Because Your Mama Taught You Right)

- 🌐 Minimal external dependencies (we're not party people)
- ✅ All transactions need your thumbs-up (no ninja moves here)
- 🧪 Test mode for practice (like training wheels, but cooler)
