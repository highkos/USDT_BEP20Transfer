Are you tired of that heart-stopping moment when you realize you might have sent your USDT to the wrong network? Say goodbye to those crypto-anxiety moments! This magical .NET 6 tool is here to save your day (and your tokens)! ?????

## ? What's This Sorcery?

### ?? Features That'll Make You Go "Wow!"

- ?? Fort Knox-level security for your private keys (minus the armed guards)
- ?? Real-time balance checking (because surprises are for birthdays, not crypto)
- ? Smart gas estimation (like a crypto-savvy car mechanic)
- ?? Test mode (for when you want to practice without the "oops" factor)
- ?? Transaction tracking with BscScan (like a GPS for your tokens)
- ??? Bulletproof error handling (we catch errors faster than you can say "blockchain")
- ? BSC network support (faster than your cat chasing a laser pointer)

## ?? Getting Started (It's Easy-Peasy!)

### ?? Prerequisites (The Boring-But-Important Stuff)

- ?? .NET 6.0 SDK (because we're fancy and modern)
- ?? A BSC wallet with:
  - USDT tokens (BEP20 flavor - the yummy one)
  - Some BNB for gas (think of it as tip money for the blockchain)
- ?? Binance TR account (your token's final destination)

### ????? Quick Start (Speed Run Edition)

1. Clone this repo faster than you can say "cryptocurrency":
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/USDT_BEP20Transfer.git
   ```

2. Build it like Bob the Builder:
   ```bash
   cd USDT_BEP20Transfer
   dotnet build
   ```

3. Run it like Forrest Gump:
   ```bash
   dotnet run
   ```

## ?? Configuration (The Control Panel)

First launch will create your `appsettings.json` - your personal command center! Here's what you can tweak:

- ?? **From Address**: Your BSC wallet (where your tokens are chillin')
- ?? **Binance TR Address**: The VIP entrance to your Binance TR account
- ?? **Private Key**: Your super-secret key (Shhhh! ??)
- ?? **Transfer Amount**: How many USDT are making the journey
- ?? **Test Mode**: Training wheels for the cautious (and the wise!)
- ? **Gas Settings**: For the speed demons and penny-pinchers

## ?? How to Use (For Humans)

1. ?? Launch the app (no rocket science degree required)
2. ?? Configure your settings (like customizing your character in a game)
3. ?? Toggle test mode (because YOLO is not a good crypto strategy)
4. ?? Make your transfer (and feel like a crypto pro!)
5. ?? Track your transaction (watch your tokens travel in style)

## ??? Safety First! (Because Your Mama Taught You Right)

- ?? Private keys stay on your PC (like that embarrassing photo from 2009)
- ?? Minimal external dependencies (we're not party people)
- ? All transactions need your thumbs-up (no ninja moves here)
- ?? Test mode for practice (like training wheels, but cooler)

## ?? Validation Checks (Our OCD Feature List)

We check everything! Like your mom checking your room, but for crypto:
- ? Address format (no funny business allowed)
- ? Balance check (can't send what you don't have!)
- ? Gas fees (no empty tank surprises)
- ? Contract validation (trust, but verify!)
